# Climate History Timeline
This collaborative project, now titled *Climates and Peoples of the Past*, was developed for the [Climate History Network](http://www.climatehistory.net/) (CHN) in collaboration with [the Climate Museum](http://www.climatemuseum.org). Students and academics can add events to the timeline through a Google Form, which automatically formats the submission for export as a D3-ready CSV.
